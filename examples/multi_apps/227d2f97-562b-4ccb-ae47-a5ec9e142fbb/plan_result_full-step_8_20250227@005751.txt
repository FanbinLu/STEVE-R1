To proceed with your task:
1. Copy the image from GIMP.
2. Paste the image into a LibreOffice Writer document.
3. Save the document as 'image.docx' on the Desktop.

This screenshot shows that the image is correctly loaded and ready for further actions in GIMP.
The previous action of copying the image from GIMP using Ctrl+C was executed correctly. The message "Copied layer to the clipboard" at the bottom of the GIMP window indicates that the image has been successfully copied to the clipboard.

### Immediate next step:
