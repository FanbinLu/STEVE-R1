- The user needs to open the .xcf file in GIMP and then copy it to a LibreOffice Writer document for pasting and saving it as 'image.docx' on the Desktop. This screenshot is currently focused on selecting the .xcf file within GIMP.
The previous action of clicking on "Desktop" in the navigation panel of GIMP's Open Image dialog was executed correctly. This action successfully navigated to the Desktop folder, where my .xcf file is stored.

The current screenshot shows that my .xcf file, named "QTDHnLCqfJbBLJ-200-80.xcf", is visible in the list of files within the Desktop folder. No unexpected events occurred, and everything appears to be progressing as expected.

Now I need to proceed by selecting and opening this .xcf file so that I can import it into GIMP for further steps in my task. At this point, I am ready to perform any subsequent actions required to complete my task successfully.
