This screenshot indicates that the image has been successfully pasted into a new document in LibreOffice Writer. To complete the task of saving the document as 'image.docx' on your Desktop, you would need to use the File menu to save the document with the specified name and location.
The previous action of pasting the copied image into LibreOffice Writer was executed correctly. The current screenshot shows that the image has been successfully pasted into a new document in LibreOffice Writer.

However, there is one issue visible in the screenshot. The document is currently untitled ("Untitled 1 - LibreOffice Writer"), which means I need to save it properly with the filename 'image.docx' on the Desktop.

### Step-by-step plan:
1. Copy the image from GIMP using Ctrl+C or right-clicking on the image and selecting 'Copy'. (DONE)
2. Open LibreOffice Writer. (DONE)
3. Paste the copied image into a new document. (DONE)
4. Save the document as 'image.docx' on your Desktop. (TODO)

### Immediate next step:
I will now save this new document as 'image.docx' on your Desktop.

### Next Action:
I will click on "File" in the top menu bar of LibreOffice Writer to open the save options.

```

```rationale
Clicking on "File" will allow us to access options for saving the document with a specific name and location.

```
