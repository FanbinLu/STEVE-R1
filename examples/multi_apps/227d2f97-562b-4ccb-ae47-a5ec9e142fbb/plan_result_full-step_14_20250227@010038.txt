This screenshot shows that the user is in the process of saving a document in LibreOffice Writer and has navigated to the Desktop directory but has not yet specified a file name or saved it with a specific name.
The previous action of clicking on "Desktop" in the left navigation pane was executed correctly. The current screenshot shows that we are now in the "Desktop" directory as intended.

### Immediate next step:
To proceed with saving our document as 'image.docx' on your Desktop, we need to change the file name from "Untitled 1" to 'image.docx' in the "Name" field.

### Step-by-step plan:
1. Copy the image from GIMP using Ctrl+C or right-clicking on the image and selecting 'Copy'. (DONE)
2. Open LibreOffice Writer. (DONE)
3. Paste the copied image into a new document. (DONE)
4. Save the document as 'image.docx' on your Desktop. (IN PROGRESS)

### Next Action:
I will now change the file name in the "Name" field from "Untitled 1" to 'image.docx'.

#### Action:
