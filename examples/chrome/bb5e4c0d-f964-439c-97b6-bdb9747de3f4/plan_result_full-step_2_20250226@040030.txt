To change the main search engine to Bing, the user would typically navigate through the Chrome settings. However, this screenshot does not show the settings menu opened yet.
The action of moving the mouse to the three vertical dots (⋮) in the top-right corner of Google Chrome to open its settings menu was executed correctly. The dropdown menu is now visible on the screen.

This action was beneficial for completing my task of making Bing the default search engine because accessing this settings menu is necessary to navigate to the search engine settings.

No unexpected events occurred that would indicate a failure in executing this action. The settings menu has been successfully opened, allowing me to proceed with navigating to 'Search engine' settings in order to change the default search engine to Bing.
You are on the right track. The next step is to navigate to Chrome's 'Settings' from where you can change your default search engine.

To do this:
1. Click on 'Settings' in the dropdown menu.

Let's proceed by clicking on 'Settings'. 

Here’s what I will do next:

- Move the mouse cursor to 'Settings' in the dropdown menu and click on it.
