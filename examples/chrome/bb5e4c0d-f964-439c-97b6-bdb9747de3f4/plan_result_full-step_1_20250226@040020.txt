Since it is the first step of the task, I will first think thoroughly about the task.

Okay, let's see. The user wants to set Bing as their default search engine in Google Chrome. From the current screen description, Chrome isn't updated, and there's an update notification in the top right. But the main task is changing the search engine.

First, I need to recall how to change the default search engine in Chrome. I remember that you go into Settings, then the Search Engine section. But wait, maybe the user already tried something and got stuck. The notification about Chrome not updating might be a distraction, but it's not directly related to changing the search engine. So, I should focus on guiding them through the settings.

Step 1: Open Chrome settings. The three-dot menu in the top-right corner is where that is. Click on that, then select Settings.

Step 2: In the Settings menu, look for the Search engine section. That's usually under the 'Search' category on the left sidebar.

Step 3: Click on 'Manage search engines'. There you can add or set Bing as default. Let me check if Bing is already listed there. If not, they might need to add it manually by entering the URL for Bing's search page (like https://www.bing.com/search?q=%s) and setting it as default.

Alternatively, maybe there's a quicker way through the address bar. Typing "chrome://settings/searchEngines" directly into the address bar could take them there faster.

Wait, but the user mentioned "main search thingy", which might be a bit of a colloquial expression but likely refers to changing the default search engine used in Chrome's address bar and other searches.

So steps would be:

1. Open Chrome settings via three-dot menu.
2. Navigate to Search engine settings.
3. Change default to Bing.
4. Test by searching something to confirm.

Also, check if after updating Chrome (if they decide to do that), maybe there's an option to use Bing as default once updated. But since we don't know if updating would affect this setting, better stick to changing it through settings regardless of updates.

Possible issues: If Bing isn't listed, they have to add it manually by clicking 'Add' and entering details. Maybe also check if Chrome is up-to-date affects anything else, but since Bing is a separate setting from updates, it should be okay.

Here is the final step-by-step solution.

**Solution:** To set Bing as your default search engine in Google Chrome, follow these steps:

---

**TODO Steps:**

1. **Open Chrome Settings**  
   - **Action:** Click on the **three vertical dots (⋮)** in the top-right corner of Chrome (next to your profile icon).  
   - **Purpose:** Access Chrome’s configuration menu.

2. **Navigate to Search Engine Settings**  
   - **Action:** In the dropdown menu, select **Settings** → Scroll down to the **Search engine** section on the left sidebar → Click on **Manage search engines and site search** (or type `chrome://settings/searchEngines` directly into Chrome’s address bar).  
   - **Purpose:** Directly access search engine configuration.

3. **Set Bing as Default Search Engine**  
   - **Action:** Under **Search engines**, click **Make default** next to **Bing** (or click **Add** → Enter `https://www.bing.com/search?q=%s` as the URL and set it as default).  
   - **Purpose:** Ensure all searches are processed via Bing.

4. **Verify Changes**  
   - **Action:** Type a test query in Chrome’s address bar → Confirm results come from Bing instead of Google.

---

**Notes:**  
- If Bing isn’t listed under "Search engines," manually add it by selecting "Add" → Name: "Bing" → URL: `https://www.bing.com/search?q=%s` → Set as default.
- No need to update Chrome first—it’s unrelated to this task.<|end_of_thought|>

The current screen shows Google Chrome with an update notification suggesting that we can relaunch it for updates or install it again. However, our task is simply changing Google Chrome's default search engine to Bing which can be done through its settings without needing an update at this moment.

To accomplish this task:
1. We need to open Google Chrome's settings menu.
2. Navigate to 'Search engine' settings.
3. Change Bing as a default search engine if available or add it manually if not.
4. Verify that Bing has been set correctly by conducting a test search within Google Chrome’s address bar.

The first step is to click on the three vertical dots (⋮) in the top-right corner of Google Chrome to open its settings menu.
```

```rationale
To proceed with changing Google Chrome's default search engine, we must first access its settings through the three vertical dots menu in the top-right corner.

computer.mouse.move("<|object_ref_start|>three vertical dots (⋮) in the top-right corner of Google Chrome<|object_ref_end|><|point_start|>(643,180)<|point_end|>") # Move mouse cursor to three vertical dots
computer.mouse.single_click() # Open settings menu
