The user wants to set Bing as their default search engine in Google Chrome. From the current screen description, Chrome isn't updated, and there's an update notification in the top right. But the main task is changing the search engine.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how to change the default search engine in Chrome. I remember that you go into Settings, then the Search Engine section. But wait, maybe the user already tried something and got stuck. The notification about Chrome not updating might be a distraction, but it's not directly related to changing the search engine. So, I should focus on guiding them through the settings.\n\nStep 1: Open Chrome settings. The three-dot menu in the top-right corner is where that is. Click on that, then select Settings.\n\nStep 2: In the Settings menu, look for the Search engine section. That's usually under the 'Search' category on the left sidebar.\n\nStep 3: Click on 'Manage search engines'. There you can add or set Bing as default. Let me check if Bing is already listed there. If not, they might need to add it manually by entering the URL for Bing's search page (like https://www.bing.com/search?q=%s) and setting it as default.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a quicker way through the address bar. Typing \"chrome://settings/searchEngines\" directly into the address bar could take them there faster.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned \"main search thingy\", which might be a bit of a colloquial expression but likely refers to changing the default search engine used in Chrome's address bar and other searches.\n\nSo steps would be:\n\n1. Open Chrome settings via three-dot menu.\n2. Navigate to Search engine settings.\n3. Change default to Bing.\n4. Test by searching something to confirm.\n\nAlso, check if after updating Chrome (if they decide to do that), maybe there's an option to use Bing as default once updated. But since we don't know if updating would affect this setting, better stick to changing it through settings regardless of updates.\n\nPossible issues: If Bing isn't listed, they have to add it manually by clicking 'Add' and entering details. Maybe also check if Chrome is up-to-date affects anything else, but since Bing is a separate setting from updates, it should be okay.\n\nHere is the final step-by-step solution.\n\n**Solution:** To set Bing as your default search engine in Google Chrome, follow these steps:\n\n---\n\n**TODO Steps:**\n\n1. **Open Chrome Settings**  \n   - **Action:** Click on the **three vertical dots (\u22ee)** in the top-right corner of Chrome (next to your profile icon).  \n   - **Purpose:** Access Chrome\u2019s configuration menu.\n\n2. **Navigate to Search Engine Settings**  \n   - **Action:** In the dropdown menu, select **Settings** \u2192 Scroll down to the **Search engine** section on the left sidebar \u2192 Click on **Manage search engines and site search** (or type `chrome://settings/searchEngines` directly into Chrome\u2019s address bar).  \n   - **Purpose:** Directly access search engine configuration.\n\n3. **Set Bing as Default Search Engine**  \n   - **Action:** Under **Search engines**, click **Make default** next to **Bing** (or click **Add** \u2192 Enter `https://www.bing.com/search?q=%s` as the URL and set it as default).  \n   - **Purpose:** Ensure all searches are processed via Bing.\n\n4. **Verify Changes**  \n   - **Action:** Type a test query in Chrome\u2019s address bar \u2192 Confirm results come from Bing instead of Google.\n\n---\n\n**Notes:**  \n- If Bing isn\u2019t listed under \"Search engines,\" manually add it by selecting \"Add\" \u2192 Name: \"Bing\" \u2192 URL: `https://www.bing.com/search?q=%s` \u2192 Set as default.\n- No need to update Chrome first\u2014it\u2019s unrelated to this task.<|end_of_thought|>\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n```thoughts\nThe current screen shows Google Chrome with an update notification suggesting that we can relaunch it for updates or install it again.
