The screenshot shows the Google Chrome Settings page. The following UI elements are visible:

- The browser is open to the 'Settings' page (chrome://settings).
- At the top right corner, there is a notification saying "Relaunch to update" and a Chrome profile icon.
- A notification bar at the top indicates "Software Updates Available to Download Please download waiting software updates."
- The main content area displays options under 'You and Google':
  - "Get Google smarts in Chrome" with a blue button labeled "Turn on sync..."
  - "Sync and Google services"
  - "Customise your Chrome profile"
  - "Import bookmarks and settings"

To change the default search engine to Bing, you would typically need to find the 'Search engine' settings within these Chrome settings. This specific section is not visible in the current screenshot, so it may require scrolling down or searching for 'Search engine' in the settings menu.
I see that the current screenshot shows that we are still on the Settings page of Google Chrome. However, it seems we have not yet scrolled down to locate the 'Search engine' section, which is necessary for changing the default search engine to Bing.

My previous action of scrolling down was intended to find the 'Search engine' section within the settings. However, it seems that this action was not executed correctly or did not result in any visible change on the screen.

To proceed with changing Google Chrome's default search engine to Bing, I need to ensure that I locate and navigate to the 'Search engine' section within these settings. This may involve scrolling down further or using a search function within the settings page.
To proceed with changing Google Chrome's default search engine to Bing, we need to locate and navigate to the 'Search engine' section within the Settings page. Since the screen has not changed after scrolling down, let's use a more efficient approach:
