The user wants to copy the \"Revenue\" column (which is column A) along with the header to a new sheet in LibreOffice Calc. The current screen shows they're on Sheet1.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the steps to copy a column. In Excel, you can select the column header and drag it, but in LibreOffice, maybe it's similar. Alternatively, using the menu options.\n\nLooking at the toolbar, there's a \"Copy\" button. But copying a range might be better. The user wants to copy the entire column A from A1 to A20. So selecting A1 to A20 and then copying would work. But how to do that in LibreOffice.\n\nAnother method: right-click on column A header and choose copy. Then go to a new sheet and paste. But since there's a new sheet already (Sheet1 is active), maybe they can create a new sheet first.\n\nWait, creating a new sheet would be step 1. Then select the data and copy-paste into the new sheet. Alternatively, use drag-and-drop while holding Ctrl or Shift? Or is that for moving columns?\n\nLet me think. If you select A1:A20 and right-click, then copy. Then go to another sheet (like Sheet1), right-click on cell A1 there and paste. That should create a copy in a new sheet. Alternatively, use the \"Move or Copy\" option from the right-click menu.\n\nBut in the toolbar, there's also a \"Move or Copy\" button which might be useful here. If they select the data (A1:A20), click Move or Copy, choose New Sheet from another sheet, then paste there.\n\nAlternatively, using keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+C to copy after selecting, then go to new sheet and Ctrl+V to paste. But since the user is on Sheet1, maybe they need to navigate to another sheet first.\n\nWait, when creating a new sheet in LibreOffice Calc, you can rename it if needed. The steps would be:\n\n1. Select column A (A1:A20).\n2. Copy using Ctrl+C or the Copy button.\n3. Create a new sheet.\n4. Go back to original Sheet1.\n5. Paste into new sheet.\n\nBut how exactly does creating a new sheet work? Maybe right-clicking on a sheet tab and selecting New Sheet? Or using the toolbar's Insert Sheet option.\n\nAlternatively, once you have copied the data, you can create a new sheet by right-clicking on an existing sheet tab and selecting Insert Sheet.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n- Select column A (A1:A20).\n- Copy this range.\n- Create a new sheet (Sheet2).\n- Go back to Sheet1.\n- Paste into H1 (assuming H is where they want it; but maybe into another cell like F1; need to check where they want it).\n\nWait, but pasting into which cell depends on where they want it in the new sheet. If they want Revenue in column F of Sheet2 (assuming F is where it's going), then after pasting into H1 of Sheet1, they could maybe drag the formula over or adjust accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, after creating Sheet2:\n\n- Right-click on H1 of Sheet2 and choose Paste.\n\nBut maybe better to have them specify where exactly they want it copied.\n\nWait, original task says \"copy the 'Revenue' column along with the header to a new sheet.\" So perhaps copying from A1 down through A20 as one block and pasting as one block in the new sheet.\n\nBut how does creating a new sheet from another one affect things? If you copy from one sheet and paste into another via Move or Copy dialog, you can choose which sheets to move or copy between.\n\nAlternatively, using drag-and-drop with Ctrl key: select column A from Sheet1, hold Ctrl key while dragging to another sheet tab (like Sheet2) would copy instead of move. But that requires knowing about Ctrl key behavior for moving vs copying columns.\n\nBut given that user might not be familiar with keyboard shortcuts for moving vs copying columns in LibreOffice Calc, using copy-paste via menu options might be more straightforward.\n\nPutting together steps:\n\nSolution 1:\n\nTODO: Select cells A1 through A20 by clicking and dragging or double-clicking column header A if selected range is contiguous.\nTODO: Click \"Copy\" button in toolbar (or press Ctrl+C).\nTODO: Right-click on any cell in an existing worksheet tab (e.g., \"Sheet1\") > choose \"New\" > \"Sheet\" > name it (e.g., \"Revenue\").\nTODO: In the new sheet (e.g., \"Revenue\"), click on cell F1 (assuming headers are placed there) > Click \"Paste\" button in toolbar (or press Ctrl+V).\n\nSolution 2:\n\nTODO: Select cells A1 through A20 by clicking and dragging or double-clicking column header A.\nTODO: Go to `Edit > Move or Copy`.\nTODO: In dialog box:\n   - Ensure \"Replace destination content\" is checked.\n   - Select \"New Worksheet\" from dropdown.\n   - Click OK.\n   - Name destination worksheet if prompted.\nTODO: In original Sheet1, place cursor where desired location for copied data\n   - For example: If user wants headers moved but data remains in original place:\n     - Click anywhere within original data range after step 3a above.\n     - Click \"Move or Copy\".\n     - Ensure source data remains selected.\n     - Check \"Move\" option instead of replacing content.\n     - Choose destination as same worksheet.\n     - Click OK.\n\nBut considering best practice for copying entire columns without altering originals:\n\nSolution 3:\n\nTODO: Select entire Column A by clicking on its header 'A'.\nTODO: Right-click selected column header > Choose 'Copy'.\nTODO: Right-click on any empty cell in another worksheet tab > Choose 'Paste'.\n\nBut this would only copy headers if those cells are empty; otherwise headers would be duplicated.\n\nGiven that user wants both headers and data copied:\n\nSolution 4:\n\nTODO: Select Column A Data Range (A1:A20).\nTODO: Copy via `Edit > Copy` or `Ctrl+C`.\nTODO: Navigate to desired location for pasting (new sheet).\nTODO: Paste via `Edit > Paste` or `Ctrl+V`.\n\nThis will create a duplicate of Column A with its header if headers are present in original cells; otherwise just headers.\n\nBetween these options:\n\nSolution 3 is quick but may lead to headers being duplicated if existing cells have data; Solution 4 ensures headers are copied with corresponding rows only when data exists in all rows.\n\nHowever, since original task states \"copy revenue column along with header,\" perhaps Solution 3 is acceptable unless data exists beyond row 20 which could cause duplicates if headers are present in other rows beyond row 20. To avoid duplicates when headers are present:\n\nBest Solution:\n\nSolution 4 ensures that only headers are copied regardless of existing data rows beyond row 20 by selecting just Column A's range without including headers themselves.\n\nTherefore:\n\nStep-by-step plan using Solution 4:\n\nSelect entire Column A Data Range: Click on cell A1 then drag down through row 20; OR double-click column header 'A' if contiguous selection is active.\n\nCopy Range: Use `Edit > Copy` or `Ctrl+C`.\n\nNavigate to Target Location: Create New Sheet via `Insert > Worksheet > New Worksheet`, name appropriately like \"Revenue\".\n\nPaste Data into New Sheet Cells starting from H1 (assuming headers need placement here):\n\nIn New Sheet:\n- Click cell H1\n- Paste via `Edit > Paste` or `Ctrl+V`.\n\nThus steps would be:\n\nTODO Steps:\n\nSelect Column Data Range:\n   - Click cell 'A' at row 1\n   - Drag down through row 20\n\nCopy Range:\n   - Select entire range by dragging over all cells from 'A' up until row number\n   - Press `Ctrl+C` or click \"Copy\" button\n\nCreate New Worksheet:\n   - Right-click any existing worksheet tab \u2192 Select `New`\n   - Name newly created sheet (e.g., \"Revenue\")\n\nPaste Data:\n   - Navigate back to original Sheet\n   - Place cursor where desired location for pasted\n     - For example: Cell F5 if headers are intended there\n   - Press `Ctrl+V` or click \"Paste\"\n\nThis solution ensures only actual revenue values are copied without duplication of headers unless necessary data exists beyond row 20 which may not be intended here.<|end_of_thought|>\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n```thoughts\nThe task requires copying the entire \"Revenue\" column along with its header into a new worksheet within LibreOffice Calc.
