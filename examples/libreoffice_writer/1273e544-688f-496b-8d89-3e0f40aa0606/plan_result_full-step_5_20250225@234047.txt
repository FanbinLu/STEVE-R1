In the current screenshot, you are using LibreOffice Calc. Here are the details:

1. **Spreadsheet Name**: The file is named "NetIncome.xlsx".
2. **Sheet Tabs**: There are two sheets open - "Sheet1" and "Sheet2". You are currently on "Sheet2".
3. **Selected Cell**: Cell A1 is selected.
4. **Highlighted Cells**: Column A is highlighted from row 1 to row 20, indicating that the "Revenue" column along with the header is selected.
5. **Toolbar Buttons**: The toolbar includes options for various actions such as formatting text, inserting rows/columns, sorting, filtering, and more.
6. **Top Bar**: A notification banner is displayed with the message "Help us make LibreOffice even better! Your donations support our worldwide community." with options to "Get involved" or "Donate".
7. **System Tray**: The system tray shows the date and time as "Feb 26 07:40".
8. **Desktop Icons**: Various desktop icons are visible on the left side of the screen, including a web browser, file manager, and other applications.

The current sheet (Sheet2) is ready for pasting the copied data from the "Revenue" column along with its header.
I see that I have successfully clicked on cell 'A1' in 'Sheet2', which is now selected. This was a necessary step before pasting the copied data from Column A (Revenue) into this new sheet.

The next step would be to paste the copied data into this new sheet by pressing `Ctrl+V`. This action will complete the task of copying the "Revenue" column along with its header to a new sheet.

No unexpected events occurred in this step, and everything appears to be proceeding correctly towards completing the task.
### Task Analysis
We have successfully copied the entire "Revenue" column along with its header from 'A' row 1 down through row 20 using `Ctrl+C`. We have also created a new sheet and navigated to it. The current screen shows that we are now on "Sheet2".

### Step-by-Step Plan
Here is the updated step-by-step plan:

1. Select all cells within Column A from 'A' down through 'A' row 20. (DONE)
2. Copy the selected range using `Ctrl+C`. (DONE)
3. Create a new sheet in LibreOffice Calc by clicking on the "+" icon next to the existing sheet tab labeled "Sheet1". (DONE)
4. Paste the copied range into the new sheet by pressing `Ctrl+V`. (TODO)

### Next Immediate Step
To paste the copied data into this new sheet:

1. Press `Ctrl+V` to paste our copied data from Column A (Revenue) into 'Sheet2'.

Let's proceed with pasting the copied data into 'Sheet2'.
