To copy the "Revenue" column along with the header to a new sheet, you would typically use the "Move or Copy" option in the toolbar or right-click context menu. However, this screenshot does not display that action directly.
The previous action of copying the selected range using `Ctrl+C` was executed correctly. The current screenshot confirms that the "Revenue" column along with its header has been copied to the clipboard as it remains highlighted and selected.

There are no visible errors or unexpected events in the current screenshot. The user can now proceed with pasting this copied data into a new sheet to complete the task. The copy operation was successful and beneficial for accomplishing the task of moving the "Revenue" column with its header to a new sheet.
### Task Analysis:
The user has successfully copied the "Revenue" column along with its header from 'A' row 1 down through row 20. The next step involves creating a new sheet and pasting this copied range into it.

### Step-by-Step Plan:
1. Select all cells within Column A from 'A' down through 'A' row 20. (DONE)
2. Copy the selected range using the Copy button in the toolbar or keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+C`. (DONE)
3. Create a new sheet in LibreOffice Calc. (TODO)
4. Paste the copied range into the new sheet. (TODO)

### Next Immediate Step:
To create a new sheet in LibreOffice Calc:

1. Click on the "+" icon located next to the existing sheet tab labeled "Sheet1".

I will now click on the "+" icon to create a new sheet.
