The user is currently performing tasks related to copying or moving data within Sheet1 in LibreOffice Calc. The Revenue column from A1 to A20 is highlighted and ready for further actions like copying or pasting into a new sheet.
The previous action was intended to select all cells within Column A from 'A' down through 'A' row 20. The action was executed correctly as evidenced by the current screenshot showing that cells from 'A' row 1 down to 'A' row 20 are highlighted.

The current screenshot confirms that the entire "Revenue" column along with its header has been successfully selected. This selection includes both the header ('Revenue') and all data entries ('39929', '55389', etc.), which aligns with the task requirement. No unexpected events occurred during this action.

The next step in the task would be to copy this selection and paste it into a new sheet.
### Task Analysis:
The user has successfully selected the entire "Revenue" column along with its header from 'A' row 1 down through row 20. The next step involves copying this selection and pasting it into a new sheet.

The current screen shows that all cells from Column A starting at row 1 ('A' cell) down through row 20 ('A' row) have been successfully selected. This selection includes both headers and data entries under it. Our next step is to copy this selected range so that we can paste it into a new sheet as required by the task.

We will use the `Ctrl+C` keyboard shortcut to copy this selection since it is a reliable method for copying ranges in LibreOffice Calc.
